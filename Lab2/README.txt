Lab 2: Simple Data Path

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user will input a number from the keypad, and choose a register to store
the value. They will then input a second number and store it in another register. The output
from the ALU should be 4-bit bitwise left rotation. The first input is the value that will be 
rotated, and the second input is the amount of rotations to do. The user then stores the ALU 
output in one of the registers.
